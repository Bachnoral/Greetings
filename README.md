# Greetings
After years as a Technical Illustrator finally convincing a company to use cad data and shoot to line for publication manuals... almost a decade ago, I am now fully into 3D modeling and working further into all aspects of Blender 3d at www.blender.org 

I do have MODO, Lightwave and sometimes go there for fun too.  All of my modeling is in Blender since my start in blender 2.49.  I still have a fondness for version 2.49, however Blender has become so powerful, it's difficult not to keep moving up and forward.

I build up my own computers, help other people when possible.  I am not a programmer, however over the years some aspects of programming are starting to be familiar to me, so... I may return to studies in certain programming environments.  First will be Python since Blender uses this.

Here, I will be placing some of my ideas about how I utilize the vast quantity of Blender addons (plugine) from sources all over the world.  Many free, lots of them are cheap (inexpensive), and most are moderately prices.

www.cgcookie.com was my first online step into tutorials.  I started with them when they started and am still with them on all their wonderful programs and offering.

Over time, I will begin adding links to other sources like my sketchfab account, as well as some history of my early life now on my Flicker account.

Soon, you will find examples of my 3D modeling as well as renders.

I would enjoy conversations anytime as long as we are talking and enjoy the exchange.

Best wishes to everyone,

ron
